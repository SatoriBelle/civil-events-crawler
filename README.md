[Civil](https://joincivil.com/) is a decentralized and censorship resistant ecosystem for online Journalism. Read more in our whitepaper.

This repository contains open-source code to capture and handle Civil-specific smart contract event log data. It is written in `golang`. It currently captures Civil TCR and Civil Newsroom related events, but can be expanded to capture additional events.
